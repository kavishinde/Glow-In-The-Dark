# Glow-In-The-Dark

Undergraduate final year project. Its aim is to help with seat identification in a theatre with minimal disturbance.

Developed in two parts:-
1. Android app which scans the QR code on the movie ticket and redirects user to page to let them toggle their seat light in order to find it with ease.
2. Python script deployed on a RaspberryPi to pull the requests from the database(Firebase) and relay the message to the connected lights.
